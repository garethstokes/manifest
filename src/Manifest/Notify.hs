-- | The change feed's subscriber half. A 'Change' is a WAKE-UP — a hint that
-- current state for a table moved — never data: consumers re-read. A missed
-- notification (listener not yet attached, connection drop, queue overflow)
-- means staleness until the next write; pollable consumers should poll as a
-- backstop. Durable delivery is the (future) event-store's job, not this
-- feed's. Emission lives in "Manifest.Session" behind the per-entity
-- @notifyChanges@ flag.

-- to the callback. The callback runs on this thread: slow callbacks delay
-- subsequent deliveries — hand off if you do real work. Throws 'DbException'
-- on connection loss; exceptions thrown by the callback propagate unwrapped
-- (dropping queued notifications with them). Retry\/supervision is the
-- caller's policy.

-- Note: channel identifiers longer than 63 bytes are truncated by LISTEN while
