# manifest

The Unit-of-Work layer Haskell never had.

The Haskell ecosystem has excellent *Core* layers — beam, rel8, esqueleto,
opaleye give you type-safe, composable SQL — but no real *ORM* layer. Nobody had
ported SQLAlchemy's **Unit of Work**: a session with an identity map, change
tracking that emits minimal `UPDATE`s, relationship-loading strategies, and
cascades. That gap exists because the obvious implementation relies on mutating
objects in place, which is unidiomatic — even impossible — in Haskell.

Manifest closes it. It is a SQLAlchemy-style Unit of Work sitting on a thin,
owned, Higher-Kinded-Data Core, with a derive layer that turns plain record
declarations into schema, CRUD, relationships, and migrations.

```haskell
withSession pool $ do
  u <- add (User { userId = 0, userName = "Ada", userEmail = Just "ada@x.io" } :: User)
  withTransaction $ save (u { userName = "Bob" } :: User)
  --                                        ^ edit a plain value;
  --   flush computes the minimal write: UPDATE users SET user_name = $1 WHERE user_id = $2
```

## Why

In SQLAlchemy you edit an object and the session works out the SQL. In Haskell a
value has no hidden state, so the trick everyone reached for — observe a mutation
in place — does not exist. Manifest takes the honest path: identity is the
**primary key** (a field on the record), and you hand the edited value back with
`save`. The session diffs it against the snapshot it took when the value entered
the session and emits an `UPDATE` touching only the columns that actually
changed. You never hand-write SQL; you never tell it which columns are dirty.

## What

One record declaration serves three jobs. A higher-kinded record `UserT f`
collapses, in `Identity` context, to the clean runtime value `type User =
UserT Identity`; in query context the same fields become typed column references
(`#userName`). `deriving Generic` plus an `Entity` instance derives the table
metadata, the row codec, and the generic CRUD the session drives. You write that
record and instance by hand, or generate them from one block with the `mkEntity`
Template Haskell macro — the runtime is identical either way.

On top of that Core sits the session: an identity map, the four entity states
(transient → pending → persistent → deleted), snapshot-diff change tracking, an
insert→update→delete flush, relationship loading (two paths, `selectin` vs
`joined`), and onDelete cascades applied at flush.

## How

- **[Getting started](getting-started.md)** — define a table, open a session,
  do a first round-trip (`add` / `get` / `save`).
- **[Entities](entities.md)** — HKD records, `Col`/`Identity` erasure,
  `deriving Generic` + the `Entity` instance, keys, and `#label` column refs.
- **[Unit of Work](unit-of-work.md)** — the `Db` monad, the identity map, the
  four states, snapshot-diff, and the flush algorithm.
- **[Relationships](relationships.md)** — the A-path (`load`) and D-path
  (`Ent` / `with` / `rel`), `selectin` vs `joined`, and one-level nesting.
- **[Cascades](cascades.md)** and **[Migrations](migrations.md)** — onDelete
  policies, and records as the schema source of truth.
- **[Tutorials](tutorials/index.md)** — literate Haskell pages that are also
  runnable tests in the suite.

## Examples

The clearest examples are the [Tutorials](tutorials/index.md): each is a literate
`.lhs` file that the test suite compiles and runs against a real Postgres, so the
code on the page is the code that runs. Start with
[Unit of Work](tutorials/Tutorial/UnitOfWork.lhs).

## Status

Manifest is real and tested for the Unit of Work, relationships, cascades,
migrations, and the Template Haskell entity front-end (the parts the reference
pages document). One surface named in the design is **Planned**, not built — do
not assume it works yet:

- **Joins and aggregates in the query Core** — the standalone query AST does not
  yet expose joins/aggregates (relationship loading *does* use a `LEFT JOIN`
  internally; that is a separate, working path).

The **`mkEntity` Template Haskell macro** generates the `UserT f` record +
`deriving Generic` + the `Entity` instance from one terse block
([Entities](entities.md)); it builds the core entity, while relationships and
cascades are still declared by hand. Hand-writing the record + instance remains
fully supported and is what the snippets above show.

The site is published by **GitHub Pages' built-in Jekyll build** of `docs/` —
there is no Actions workflow. The tutorials run as tests and require a Postgres
(the suite spins up an ephemeral one); a local Jekyll build is out of scope.
