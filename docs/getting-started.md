# Getting started

This walks through the three things you need to use Manifest: **define a table**,
**open a session**, and do a **first round-trip** (`add` / `get` / `save`). Every
snippet below matches the real API — the same surface the
[tutorials](tutorials/index.md) compile and run as tests.

## Why

A Manifest table is one higher-kinded record. That single declaration gives you
the clean runtime value, the typed column references the query layer uses, and —
via `deriving Generic` and an `Entity` instance — the table metadata, the row
codec, and the generic CRUD the session drives. You write that record and
instance by hand (shown below), or generate them from one block with the
`mkEntity` macro ([Entities](entities.md)).

## What

### 1. Define a table

A table is a record parameterized by a functor `f`, with each field wrapped in
`Col f`. In `Identity` context `Col` erases its markers, so `type User = UserT
Identity` is the plain value `userId :: Int, userName :: Text, userEmail :: Maybe
Text`. The `PrimaryKey (Serial Int)` marker is visible to the metadata deriver
but invisible in the value.

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE DataKinds #-}
{-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric #-}
{-# LANGUAGE TypeApplications #-}
{-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies #-}

import Data.Functor.Identity (Identity)
import Data.Text (Text)
import GHC.Generics (Generic)
import Manifest

data UserT f = User
  { userId    :: Col f (PrimaryKey (Serial Int))
  , userName  :: Col f Text
  , userEmail :: Col f (Maybe Text)
  } deriving Generic

-- The clean runtime value: userId :: Int, userName :: Text, userEmail :: Maybe Text
type User = UserT Identity

instance Entity User where
  type PrimKey User = Int
  tableMeta  = genericTableMeta @UserT "users"
  rowDecoder = genericRowDecoder
  rowEncode  = genericRowEncode
  primKey    = userId
```

`deriving Generic` plus this `Entity` instance is everything: `genericTableMeta`
derives the table name, columns, types, PK and serial flags; `genericRowDecoder`
/ `genericRowEncode` derive the row codec; and the field labels become typed
column references (`#userName`). The session's `get` / `add` / `save` / `delete`
are generic over the `Entity` class — defining the instance is all it takes.

> **Prefer less boilerplate?** The [`mkEntity` Template Haskell macro](entities.md)
> generates this exact record + `type` synonym + `Entity` instance from one terse
> block. The hand-written form above is what it expands to.

### 2. Open a session

A session runs over a connection pool. Build a pool with `newPool` (a libpq
conninfo string and a pool size), then run a `Db` action with `withSession`:

```haskell
import qualified Data.ByteString.Char8 as BC

main :: IO ()
main = do
  pool <- newPool (BC.pack "host=localhost dbname=app user=app") 4
  withSession pool $ do
    -- a Db action: reads and writes share one session + identity map
    pure ()
  closePool pool
```

`withSession :: Pool -> Db a -> IO a` acquires a connection, sets up a fresh
identity map and pending-set, runs your action, and releases the connection.
Wrap writes you want atomic in `withTransaction` (`BEGIN` / `COMMIT`, with
rollback on exception); the flush runs on commit.

### 3. A first round-trip

```haskell
withSession pool $ do
  -- add: a Transient value -> Persistent; issues INSERT ... RETURNING pk eagerly
  -- and hands the value back with its assigned primary key.
  u <- add (User { userId = 0, userName = "Ada", userEmail = Just "ada@x.io" } :: User)

  -- get: load by primary key; the row becomes Persistent and a snapshot is taken.
  mu <- get (Key (userId u))           -- :: Db (Maybe User)

  -- save: hand the edited value back. The flush diffs it against the snapshot and
  -- emits a minimal UPDATE -- here, only user_name changed.
  withTransaction $ save (u { userName = "Bob" } :: User)
```

`add` returns the value with its serial PK filled in (you start it at `0`; the
database assigns the real id). `get (Key k)` returns `Db (Maybe User)`. `save`
takes the whole edited value — the session works out which columns changed and
writes only those.

## How (build setup)

Manifest is a Haskell library; import the umbrella module `Manifest`, which
re-exports the curated public surface (`withSession`, `add`, `get`, `save`,
`delete`, `Entity`, `Key`, the query DSL, relationships, cascades, migrations).
Add it as a dependency the way your build tool pins git dependencies, then
`import Manifest`.

> **The test suite (and the tutorials) need a Postgres.** Manifest talks to a
> real database — there is no in-memory backend. The suite spins up an ephemeral,
> isolated Postgres per run (`initdb` + `pg_ctl` on a private socket; see
> `test/Fixtures.hs`), so you need `initdb`, `pg_ctl`, and `psql` on `PATH`. The
> dev shell provides them. Running your own app just needs a Postgres reachable
> via the conninfo you pass to `newPool`.

## Examples

The [tutorials](tutorials/index.md) are the worked examples — each is a literate
Haskell page that the suite compiles and runs against Postgres:

- [Unit of Work](tutorials/Tutorial/UnitOfWork.lhs) — edit a value, get a minimal
  `UPDATE`.
- [Relationships](tutorials/Tutorial/Relationships.lhs) — load related rows two
  ways.
- [Cascades](tutorials/Tutorial/Cascades.lhs) — delete a parent, its children go
  too.

From there, the reference pages cover each layer in depth: start with
[Entities](entities.md) and [Unit of Work](unit-of-work.md).
